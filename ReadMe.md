[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/A0A81MOVN)

This is a local proxy meant to cache KC assets and bypass the gadget IP block. It can be preloaded from a cache dump (linked below). This will improve loading of assets on top of browser built-in cache.

## Installation and setup
See [Installation and setup](https://github.com/Tibowl/KCCacheProxy/wiki/Installation-and-setup) for more information. If you still have problems, try in Chrome with the extension linked there and if you still have, you can ask for help in the [reddit KC discord](https://discord.gg/RtSadWM).
